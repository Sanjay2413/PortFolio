            <h4>Vision of My Life</h4>
            <p>A vision for society is a mental picture of the future that defines the desired state. It can be a set of
                dreams and long-term goals.
                A vision for society can include:
                Equality of needs and opportunities
                Respect for human dignity
                Promotion and protection of human rights
                Social conditions that favor individual, group, and social development
                Living in a healthy natural environment
                The United Nations has a vision for an inclusive society. This vision is based on the promotion and
                protection of all human rights, as well as respect for the dignity of each individual.

            <h4>Family life is new aged joined family</h4>
            <p>In my family, we embrace the concept of a "New Age Joint Family," a modern interpretation of the
                traditional joint family system.
                Grandparents (Murugeshan and Saroja): At the heart of our family are our beloved grandparents,
                Murugeshan and Saroja.
                Parents (MohanDas and DhanaLakshmi): Our core family unit is led by our parents, MohanDas and
                DhanaLakshmi, who work tirelessly to manage our household's affairs. They instill in us the values of
                unity, love, and togetherness, providing a solid foundation for our family's growth.
                Elder Brother's Family: My elder brother, along with his wife, is an integral part of our household.
                Their presence brings an added dimension to our family dynamics, and together, they contribute to the
                nurturing and strengthening of our family bonds.
                Me (Sanjay): I am Sanjay, and as a member of this unique New Age Joint Family, I bring my own
                perspective, experiences, and aspirations to the table. I am proud to be a part of a family that values
                both tradition and modernity.
